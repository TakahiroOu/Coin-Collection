# Coin-Collection
This is an original game that can be played by one or two players.
In the game, players collect as many coins as possible. Coins fall from the sky, and the number of coins increases each round. Players must also avoid monsters and bombs.

Players start with five lives, and they can gain extra lives by collecting red hearts. (Only when their current lives are blow five.)

As the game progresses, the speed of robots, bombs, monsters, and hearts gradually increases. The game includes many gimmicks, so it helps train explosive power (quick reaction and prediction skills).

When a red heart falls, black hearts fall at the same time. Collecting a black heart spawns an additional monster. There are also small bombs and large bombs.

Players should use sound cues to predict upcoming dangers. Different sounds indicate whether hearts or bombs are falling, and the volume of explosion sound changes depending on the number and size of bombs.

Monsters and bombs can cancel coins, so players should collect coins before they disappear in order to achieve a high score.
If you can score over 1500 points, you have excellent explosive power.
